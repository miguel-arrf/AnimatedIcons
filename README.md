# AnimatedIcons

This repository contains 4 SFSymbols icons animated with SwiftUI. For now they are:
- eyedropper
  - SFSymbol was exported to Figma and then converted to a SwiftUI Shape using https://svg-to-swiftui.quassum.com/.
- swatchpalette
  - As this symbol is composed of simple stacked rectangles, it was built using `RoundedRectangle`'s.
- sparkles.square.filled.on.square
  - Composition of `RoundedRectangle`'s and two separate sparkle SFSymbols (stacked on top as `Text`'s),
- arrowshape.turn.up.backward
  - Used 2 arrowshape.turn.up.backward SFSymbols, whereas the animation is powered by an `asymmetric` transition.
